This google extensions add a new button in the youtube video player, this new button allow you to change the video speed to 3x 

First open a new tab on google and type " chrome://extensions/ "

There will be all of your extensions that you have downloaded from the store

To install this one you will need to click in a button called " developer mode ", so google will let you put your own extensions

Just click on  “ load unpacked “ and select the folder containing the files of projects

This YouTube clip show you the step-by-step:

This video was not made by me, it was made by iEatWebsites, thak you  :)

Now the extension is on, however there I a bug that I can’t correct: when you enter on a Youtube video for first time the button does not work, therefor, you just need to reload the page (click in F5 or CTRL + R) 

Lastly, the extension is working, but ever time that you open a new tab on YouTube and click on a video, you will need to reload the page
